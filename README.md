# Keyboard for the World

Just in my local area, the Pacific Northwest, there are over 100 languages where there are writers who want to have a keyboard for their language, but where there are "issues" in actually using an existing keyboard.

These languages are important for the writers, but they aren't big enough for the big companies to take on. Instead, they use keyboards either created by a small number of enthusiasts.

This project explores the Unicode CLDR keyboard data and LDML keyboard format and creates an Edge (chromium) extension that can somewhat painfully be used to enter in data in the local Lushootseed language.
